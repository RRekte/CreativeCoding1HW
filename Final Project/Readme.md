for this project I wanted to do something simpilar becasue I have stuggled with this class even since it started. I wanted to do a drawing of Darth Vader with the death star behind him. 
I've looked at a lot of different drawings people have done of him and haven't found exactly what I'm thinking of doing. I chose to do Darth Vader because I was playing Galaxy of Heroes and
I upgraded him to be my strongest charcter and I thought it would be cool to try and do it.
I have drawn up several sketches of how I want this to look and I'm still debating if I want a big or a small Death Star; im leaning towards bigger.
I'm really going to have to think hard about where I want all the lines, shapes, and potenitlaly shadows to go. also hopefuuly get my live links to work
I plan to finsih up the sketches by Thursday and pick a final design by Friday the 25th. I hope to start this on Saturday or Sunday, we will see what my work schedule is like. as of Saturday,
it has not been started yet, so hopeffuly tomorrow.

I have not compelted any work in the past week excpet for whatever the last assignment was. 
I was going to do the extra credit because I honeslty need it, still might. we will see.
