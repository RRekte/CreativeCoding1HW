GUI and CLI are two different methods used to interact with a computer and its software.
GUI stands for Graphical User interface which allows the user to use graphics to interact with an operating system. It is easy to use, but uses more memory than CLI. The GUI operating system needs a mouse and a keyboard and its appearence can be modified and changed. The input can be entered anywhere on the screen. The information is shown in forms such as plain text, videos, button, icons and other images. You can use pointing devices for selecting items 
CLI stands for Command Line Interface where a user uses a prompt to write a command to get a response from the system. It is difficult to use, but is very precise and requires only a keyboard. The appearance cannot be modified or changed. The information is shown in plain text and there are no graphics. CLI is ideal for more of the advanced user and is more challenging to learn.
